# React App Demo

Demonstrate an app using fundamentals of React including simple and class components, state, props, and submitting form data to add new data or update existing records. Users can freely **add** characters to the table, then they can **remove** any character from the table or **edit** any specific data record.

**iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are also delivered. The apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the apps through the [Expo Publish Link](https://expo.dev/@jglchen/react-app-demo) with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app.
